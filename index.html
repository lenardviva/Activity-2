            Apple released Cheetah, a MacOS 10.1, in 2001 with the aqua Apple logo, along with popular products such as the iPod, iTunes, and more. 
            It was a revolutionary year for the brand as many of its products were popular and helped Apple to earn record profits.
            In 2007, Apple changed the logo to a chrome-textured design to go with its upcoming aluminum-based products.
